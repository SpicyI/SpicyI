Greetings, I am Spicy, a cyberpunk enthusiast and aspiring programmer. Currently immersed in the realms of C and C++ ðŸ‘¾, I am captivated by the allure of low-level programming, reverse engineering, and game development. With a deep passion for the cyberpunk genre, I find solace and excitement in virtual worlds while wielding a controller as my weapon of choice ðŸ•¹. Let's embark on a journey through neon-lit cityscapes and unravel the mysteries of the digital realm together ðŸŒŒ.
